# 🌐 dbiz.ai : My Cloud Hands-On Journey  

Completed 2 months of cloud training at dbiz.ai with hands-on in AWS &amp; Azure. Worked on EC2, VPCs, S3 static hosting, IAM, Azure VMs, V-Nets, RBAC, storage accounts &amp; service bus. Gained real-world exposure that helped me earn AWS CLF-C02 &amp; Azure AZ-900 certifications."
